TO DO LIST:

####### WEB DESIGN & CSS ##########
- stop nav bar from overlapping with logo when window is resized - could we add logo to flexbox?
- get rid of scrollbar


####### WINDOW RESIZE EVENT HANDLER ########
- make game canvas handle this better.
- problems often arise when loading the page on a small window and then increasing window size.


######### JAVASCRIPT #########
- IMPLEMENT TEXTBOX FOR HELP, instructions, CONTINUATION MESSAGES ETC.
- FEWER GLOBALS - refactor! clean up lol. This will help with game canvas responsiveness.
