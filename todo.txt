TO DO LIST:

- implement win/loss animations in to the background
- add instruction tab to side of page
- better labels for buttons / add label to slider - hover labels?
- stop nav bar from overlapping with logo when window is resized, could we add logo to flexbox?
- FEWER GLOBALS.
- get rid of both scrollbars.
- get rid of press enter to play again - just have new game button.
